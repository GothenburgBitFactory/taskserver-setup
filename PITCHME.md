# Taskserver Setup

This guide leads you through all the necessary steps to setup your own Taskserver to sync your Taskwarrior-tasks.

Please follow the steps **carefully** and **note** all things you do differently.

---

# Preparation

+++

## Backup Your Data

Let's reinforce a good habit and make a backup copy of your data first. Here is a very easy way to backup your data:

```bash
$ cd ~/.task
$ tar czf task-backup-$(date +'%Y%m%d').tar.gz *
```

Now move that file to somewhere safe. All software contains bugs, so make regular backups.

+++

## Attention

This is not only due to a good habit, we will modify your data, so a backup is highly recommended.

+++

## Choose A  Machine

A suitable machine to run your Taskserver is one that is always available. If you have such a machine, or have access to a hosted machine, that is ideal.

If your machine is not continuously available, it can still be a suitable Taskserver because the sync mechanism doesn't require continuous access. When a client cannot sync, it simply accumulates local, unpropagated changes until it can sync.

A laptop is a poor choice for a Taskserver host.

+++

## Choose A Port

By default, Taskserver uses port 53589. You can choose any port you wish, provided it is unused. If you choose a port number that is under 1024, then Taskserver must run as root, which is not recommended.

+++

## User & Group

Ideally you will create a new user and group solely to run the Taskserver. This helps you keep the data secure from other users on the machine, as well as controlling the privileges of Taskserver.

+++

## Firewall

Depending on what devices you use to access your server, you may need to configure the firewall to allow incoming TCP/IP traffic on your chosen port.

---

# Installation

---

## Installation from a package

Installing Taskserver from a binary package is the simplest option, but you will need to refer to your package manager's documentation and procedures for doing this.

Take a look at the [Download](http://taskwarrior.org/download/#dist) page for examples. Generally there are too many package managers to make a complete list with instructions here.

---

## Dependencies

Before building the software, you will need to satisfy the dependencies by installing the following:

- `GnuTLS` (ideally version 3.2 or newer)
- `libuuid`
- `CMake` (2.8 or newer, check with)
- `make`
- A C++ Compiler (GCC 4.7 or Clang 3.0 or newer)

+++

## Note

Note that some OSes (Darwin, FreeBSD ...) include `libuuid` functionality in `libc`, check the following slides for more detailed instructions.

You don't necessarily need the latest version of all components, but it is a good idea if you can.  GnuTLS is a security component, and as such, it is very important that it is current.

+++

## Attention

Using GnuTLS version 2.12.x is neither adequately secure, nor production quality. Please check the slide describing the GnuTLS-Problems for details.

+++

## Operating Systems

We have detailed instructions for the following operating operating systems on the following slides:

- CentOS
- Debian
- Fedora
- openSUSE
- Ubuntu
- MacOS

+++

## Windows & others

A note on other operating systems:

- Windows with Cygwin (unsupported but working)
  - **Recommendation**: Use the Ubuntu subsystem in Windows 10 and follow the Ubuntu instructions.

In case you can add your operating system of choice, please send an email to [support@taskwarrior.org](mailto:support@taskwarrior.org) (Thank you!).

---

## Installation from a tarball

Installing Taskserver from a tarball is a matter of downloading the tarball, extracting it, satisfying dependencies and building the server.

+++

## Download

The next step is to obtain the code. This means getting the Task Server 1.1.0 (or newer) source tarball.  You should check for the latest stable release here:

[http://taskwarrior.org/download/](http://taskwarrior.org/download/)

You can download the tarball with `curl`, as an example of just one of many ways to download the tarball.

```bash
$ curl -LO https://taskwarrior.org/download/taskd-latest.tar.gz
```

+++

## Build

Expand the tarball, and build the Taskserver.

```bash
$ tar xzf taskd-latest.tar.gz
$ cd taskd-latest
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release .
...
$ make
...
```

We will refer to the directory where you extracted the data to as `SOURCEDIR` (in the example above it is `taskd-latest`).

+++

## Build Again

If you ever want to build the software again, do some cleanup.

```bash
$ cd taskd-latest
$ make clean
...
$ rm CMakeCache.txt
...
```

+++

## make install

Now install Taskserver.  This copies files into the right place, and installs man pages.

```bash
$ sudo make install
...
```

+++

## Verify installation

Run the `taskd` command to verify that the server is installed, and the location is in your `$PATH`.

You should see something like this:

```bash
$ taskd

Usage: taskd -v|--version
...
```

---

## Installation from Git-Repository

Installing Taskserver from git is a matter of cloning the git repository and building the server.

The same dependencies as for installation from tarball apply. Please check the corresponding slides.

+++

## Cloning the repository

Now clone the repository like this:

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules=yes https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskserver.git taskserver.git
...
```

+++

## Use stable!

It is highly recommended that you build the stable version. This involves simply executing the next command.

```bash
$ cd taskserver.git

$ git checkout master
...
```

Only under special circumstances you should build the unstable development version.

+++

## Special circumstances

The unstable development version is at **no point** guaranteed to work or even compile. The only time it does stabilize is right at the end of the development cycle, and in that case, you should wait until the release.

The stable version is always merged to the `master` branch, which is the default branch, so ordinarily nothing needs to be done. To build an unstable branch, first determine which branch by looking at the available branches:

+++

## Choosing the right branch

```bash
$ cd taskserver.git
$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/1.1.0
  remotes/origin/1.1.1
  remotes/origin/1.2.0
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
```

The convention we use is that `master` represents the stable release.  The numbered branches represent the latest development (1.2.0, the 'highest' branch number, ending in '.0') and a patch branch (1.1.1, ending in a non-zero number).

+++

## Development version

Patch branches are reserved for emergency releases, so in this example you would choose to build 1.2.0 as the latest development branch like this (please not that starting with version 1.2.0 we make use of submodules).

```bash
$ git checkout 1.2.0
Branch 1.2.0 set up to track remote branch 1.2.0 from origin.
Switched to a new branch '1.2.0'
```

+++

## Submodules

```bash
$ git submodule init
Submodule 'src/libshared' (https://git.tasktools.org/scm/tm/libshared.git) registered for path 'src/libshared'

$ git submodule update
Cloning into 'src/libshared'...
remote: Counting objects: 2180, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1379/1379), done.
remote: Total 2180 (delta 1641), reused 1018 (delta 796)
Receiving objects: 100% (2180/2180), 369.13 KiB | 554.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1641/1641), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
Submodule path 'src/libshared': checked out '2b0b70d90acb9a3ff3548befab9db8beb85a0c2d'
```

+++

## Build from Git

Now build the Taskserver.

```bash
$ cd taskserver.git
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release .
...
$ make
...
```

In this case the `SOURCEDIR` is `taskserver.git`.

+++

## Test your build

Having built the server, now build and run the unit tests. Although this is an optional step, it is a good idea to know whether the build works on your platform.

```bash
$ cd test # from SOURCEDIR
$ make
...
$ ./run_all

Pass:     2920
Fail:        0
Skipped:     0
Runtime:     1 seconds

$ cd ..
```

+++

## Interprete the results

This example shows that all 2,920 tests pass.  If you see test failures, stop and report them.

Note that there are some unit tests that fail if you have not built the latest commit. Seeing 4 test failures may mean all is well. Seeing 30 failures does not.

+++

## make install

Now install Taskserver. This copies files into the right place, and installs man pages.

```bash
$ sudo make install
...
```

+++

## Verify your Installation

Run the `taskd` command to verify that the server is installed, and the location is in your `$PATH`. You should see something like this:

```bash
$ taskd

Usage: taskd -v|--version
...
```

---

# Server Setup

---

## taskd-User

We assume that you will do all configuration with the taskd user you chose to run the server with.

+++

## Data Location

Configuring the server is straightforward, but needs a little planning.

A location for the data must be chosen and created. The `TASKDDATA` environment variable will be used to indicate that location to all the `taskd` commands.

```bash
$ export TASKDDATA=/var/taskd
$ sudo mkdir -p $TASKDDATA
```

If the `TASKDDATA` variable is not set, then most `taskd` commands require the `--data ...` argument.

+++

## Directory

**Everything the server does will be confined to that directory.**

There are two 'D's in `TASKDDATA`, and omitting one is a common mistake.

The user that will run the server must have write permissions in that directory.

+++

## Initialization

Now we let the server initialize that directory:

```bash
$ taskd init
You must specify the 'server' variable, for example:
taskd config server localhost:53589

Created /var/taskd
```

It is a good idea to copy the `pki` subdirectory from your `SOURCEDIR` to your `TASKDDATA` directory.

If you installed from a package (manager) search for the pki directory, `find / -name pki -type d` (example `/usr/share/taskd/pki/` for Ubuntu).

---

## Keys & Certificates

Now we create certificates and keys. The command below will generate all the certs and keys for the server, but this uses self-signed certificates, and this is not recommended for production use. This is for personal use, and this may be acceptable for you, but if not, you will need to purchase a proper certificate and key, backed by a certificate authority.

+++

## Assumptions

The scripts make assumptions ***that are guaranteed to be wrong for you***. Specifically the `generate.server` script has a hard-coded `CN` entry that is not going to work. You ***need*** to edit the `vars` file, which you find in the `pki` subdirectory in your `SOURCEDIR`.

```bash
CN=localhost
```

You will need to modify this value to match your server.

Most probably the result of `hostname -f` is exactly what you need ("yourserver.example.com").

+++

## Common Name

The value of CN (Common Name) is important.

It is this value against which Taskwarrior validates the servername, so use a value similar to `ack.example.com`, don't expect that example to work for you. If you do not change this value, the only option for the client is to skip some or all certificate validation, ***which is a bad idea***.

Go to your `SOURCEDIR`, which depends on which installation method you chose.

+++

## Copy the certificates

Here is is assumed that you installed from the source tarball.

```bash
$ cd ~/taskd-1.1.0/pki
$ ./generate
...

$ cp client.cert.pem $TASKDDATA
$ cp client.key.pem  $TASKDDATA
$ cp server.cert.pem $TASKDDATA
$ cp server.key.pem  $TASKDDATA
$ cp server.crl.pem  $TASKDDATA
$ cp ca.cert.pem     $TASKDDATA
```

+++

## Configure taskserver

```bash
$ taskd config --force client.cert $TASKDDATA/client.cert.pem
$ taskd config --force client.key  $TASKDDATA/client.key.pem
$ taskd config --force server.cert $TASKDDATA/server.cert.pem
$ taskd config --force server.key  $TASKDDATA/server.key.pem
$ taskd config --force server.crl  $TASKDDATA/server.crl.pem
$ taskd config --force ca.cert     $TASKDDATA/ca.cert.pem
```

+++

## Explanation

There are three classes of key/cert here. There is the CA (Certificate Authority) cert, which has cert signing capabilities and is used to sign and verify the other certs.

There are the server key/certs, which are used to authenticate the server and encrypt.

Finally there are client key/certs, which are not what you might  expect. These are for API access, and not for your Taskwarrior client. Those are created later.

---

## Other Configuration

Now we configure some basic details for the server.  The chosen port is 53589. Note that we allow Taskwarrior clients specifically.

```bash
$ cd $TASKDDATA/..
$ taskd config --force log $PWD/taskd.log
$ taskd config --force pid.file $PWD/taskd.pid
$ taskd config --force server localhost:53589
```

+++

## Verify

Note that we have chosen `localhost:53589`, but this choice has consequences. The name `localhost` is not network visible, which limits the server to only serving clients on the same machine. Use your full machine name for proper network addressability.

You can look at all the configuration settings:

```bash
$ taskd config
```

You can view all the supported settings with:

```bash
$ man taskdrc
```

---

## Control Server

You can now to launch the server:

```bash
$ taskdctl start # analogue stop to stop the server
```

This command launched the server as a daemon process. This command requires the `TASKDDATA` variable.  Your server is now running, and ready for syncing.

Check that your server is running by looking in the `taskd.log` file, or running this:

```bash
$ ps -leaf | grep taskd
```

+++

## Interactive or Non-Daemon Server

A daemon server is typically how you would want to run Taskserver, but there may be times when you need to run the server attached to a terminal.  These two commands are identical:

```bash
$ taskdctl start
$ taskd server --data $TASKDDATA --daemon
```

By omitting the `--daemon` option, the server remains attached to the terminal.  Then to stop the server you can enter `Ctrl-C`.

+++

## Interactive Server

The interactive mode is really only useful for debugging, in conjunction with TLS debug mode, like this:

```bash
$ taskd config debug.tls 3
$ taskd server --data $TASKDDATA
...
```

With a `debug.tls` setting that is non-zero, you see lots of security-related diagnostic output.

+++

## systemd unit file

You can start Taskserver using a systemd-unitfile (called `taskd.service`) like the one on the next slide (please add the contents of `$TASKDDATA` not the variable itself). Running the Taskserver as root is not recommended, please add an appropriate user and group to run the daemon with (`$TASKDUSER` and `$TASKDGROUP`).

+++

## taskd.service

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Secure server providing multi-user, multi-client access to Taskwarrior data
Requires=network.target
After=network.target
Documentation=http://taskwarrior.org/docs/#taskd

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/taskd server --data $TASKDDATA
Type=simple
User=$TASKDUSER
Group=$TASKDGROUP
WorkingDirectory=$TASKDDATA
PrivateTmp=true
InaccessibleDirectories=/home /root /boot /opt /mnt /media
ReadOnlyDirectories=/etc /usr

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

+++

## Control with systemd

Afterwards prepare systemd to recognise the file. The following commands need to be run as root-user.

```bash
$ cp taskd.service /etc/systemd/system
$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ systemctl start taskd.service
$ systemctl status taskd.service
```

In case everything is running fine, enable the script to start Taskserver on every boot.

```bash
$ systemctl enable taskd.service
```

---

# Client Setup

---

## Add Organization

A user account must be created, along with a key, cert and ID, before syncing may occur.

Before creating a user account, you may need to create an organization. An organization consists of a group of zero or more users. You can get away with just one organization, and in this example, we will create just one, named 'Public'.

+++

## Create Organisation

You can create as many organizations as you wish (even one per user), and the purpose is simply to group users together. Future features will utilize this.

```bash
$ taskd add org Public
Created organization 'Public'
```

Now the organization 'Public' exists, we can add users to that organization.

+++

## Create User

Now we add a new user, named 'First Last' as an example.  You can use any name you wish, and if it contains spaces, quote the name as shown.

```bash
$ taskd add user 'Public' 'First Last'
New user key: cf31f287-ee9e-43a8-843e-e8bbd5de4294
Created user 'First Last' for organization 'Public'
```

Note that you will get a different 'New user key' than is shown here, and you will need to retain it, to be used later for client configuration.  Note that the key is just a unique id, because your name alone is not necessarily unique.

+++

## Create Certificate and Key

Go to your `SOURCEDIR`, which depends on which installation method you chose. Here it is assumed that you installed from the source tarball.

```bash
$ cd ~/taskd-1.1.0/pki
$ ./generate.client first_last
```

This will generate a new key and cert, named `first_last.cert.pem` and `first_last.key.pem`. It is not important that 'first\_last' was used here, just that it is something unique, and valid for use in a file name. It has no bearing on security.

+++

## Let's encrypt

Certificates coming from Let's encrypt have **not** been successfully used by anyone.

Please remember that Let's encrypt only generates servers, but we need a client certificate as well.

A working scenario would be highly appreciated.

---

## Taskwarrior Configuration

You have now created a new user account on the server, created a new client cert and key, and have details that need to be transferred to the user, to set up a sync client.

+++

## Information needed

- `ca.cert.pem` is the certificate authority, and the only way to validate self-signed certs like ours.
- `first_last.cert.pem` is the client certificate.
- `first_last.key.pem` is the client key.
- The new user key (yours will be different): `cf31f287-ee9e-43a8-843e-e8bbd5de4294`
- The organization, `Public`.
- The full and proper user name, `First Last`.

+++

## Server address and port

The server address and port, `host.domain:53589` is needed as well.

In the server configuration we used `localhost` as an example. With `localhost` your server can not be reached from outside the machine your are running it on.

Whatever you actually used there, should be used here.

+++

## Certificates

If you have configured Taskserver and created a user account (or better yet, someone created an account for you) then you now have details needed in the configuration of your Taskwarrior client.

Now we feed this information to Taskwarrior.

+++

## Copy all of them

Copy the Cert, Key and CA to your `~/.task` directory.  The reason we are copying the CA cert is because this is a self-signed cert, and we need the CA to validate against.  Alternately we could force Taskwarrior to trust all certs, but that is not recommended.

```bash
$ cp first_last.cert.pem ~/.task
$ cp first_last.key.pem  ~/.task
$ cp ca.cert.pem         ~/.task
```

+++

## Configure Taskwarrior to use them

Now we need to make Taskwarrior aware of these certs:

```bash
$ task config taskd.certificate -- ~/.task/first_last.cert.pem
$ task config taskd.key         -- ~/.task/first_last.key.pem
$ task config taskd.ca          -- ~/.task/ca.cert.pem
```

+++

## Configure Taskserver in Taskwarrior

Now set the server info:

```bash
$ task config taskd.server      -- host.domain:53589
```

Finally we provide the credentials, which combine the organization, account name and user key:

```bash
$ task config taskd.credentials -- Public/First Last/cf31f287-ee9e-43a8-843e-e8bbd5de4294
```

Your Taskwarrior is now ready to sync.

+++

## Trust Level

It is possible to configure Taskwarrior's trust level, which determines how the server certificate is treated.

You could specify `taskd.trust=ignore hostname` to skip certificate hostname validation. ***This is a bad idea***. You can also specify `taskd.trust=allow all` to perform no validation. ***This is a worse idea***.

The default value is `taskd.trust=strict` which performs the most stringent verification, and is more secure.

+++

## Note on Taskwarrior 2.3.0

For Taskwarrior 2.3.0 you can specify `taskd.trust=yes` in order to skip certificate validation. ***This is a bad idea.*** The default is `taskd.trust=no`, which does not trust the server certificate, which is more secure.

---

# Sync

---

## First Time Sync

You will do this differently depending on whether this is the first sync per device, or one of the many subsequent syncs.

The first time you sync is special - the client sends all your tasks to the server. This is something you should only do once on only one device.

```bash
$ task sync init
Please confirm that you wish to upload all your pending tasks to the Task Server (yes/no) yes
Syncing with host.domain:53589

Sync successful.  2 changes uploaded.
```

+++

## Note

You should get an indication that tasks were uploaded, in this case 2 of them.

Please note that older Taskwarrior versions - before 2.5.1 - only sync the **pending** tasks and not all tasks.

+++

## General Sync

After the first time sync, you switch and just use this command:

```bash
$ task sync
Syncing with host.domain:53589

Sync successful.  No changes.
```

+++

## Feedback

This will give you feedback about what happened. Please note that it is perfectly safe to run this command as often as you wish. Syncing is safe and does not consume great system resources.

+++

## Connectivity

Note that if your client is a mobile device, a sync command may consume some of your data usage. Act accordingly.

But it does require network connectivity, and if there is no connectivity you will be notified.  It is not a problem if a sync fails because of this, because the next sync that works will catch up with all the changes, and do the right merging. *Taskwarrior and Taskserver were designed to work together, and tolerate intermittent connectivity*.

+++

## Sync Reminder

After you modify data locally, Taskwarrior will start notifying you that you need to sync, after commands, like this:

```bash
$ task project:foo list
No matches.
There are local changes.  Sync required.
```

This is just a reminder to sync.

+++

## Sync!

Respond with a sync, and the reminder goes away:

```bash
$ task sync
Syncing with <server>:<port>

Sync successful.  1 changes uploaded.
```

If you do not respond with a sync, then local changes accumulate unseen by other clients. When you do eventually sync, the data will be properly propagated, so it is a question of whether you *need* current data on the server. It is perfectly fine to allow *weeks* to go by without a sync.

## Troubleshooting Guide

Please note there is a troubleshooting guide as well.

You can find the recent version [here](https://gitpitch.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskserver-troubleshooting).

+++

## Getting Help

As a last resort, ask for help. But please make sure you have carefully reviewed your setup, and gone through the checks above before asking. No one wants to lead you through the steps above to discover that you didn't.

We'll ask you to provide the `diagnostics` output for both Taskwarrior and Taskserver, then we're going to go through the steps above, because this is our checklist also.

+++

## Getting Help (1)

There are several ways of getting help:

- We have an [FAQ](https://taskwarrior.org/support/faq.html) covering a lot of questions.
- Email us at [support@taskwarrior.org](mailto:support@taskwarrior.org), then wait patiently for a volunteer to respond.
- Join us IRC in the [#taskwarrior](https://botbot.me/freenode/taskwarrior/) channel on Freenode.net, and get a quick response from the community, where, as you have anticipated, we will walk you through the checklist above.

+++

## Getting Help (2)

There are several ways of getting help:

- Even though Twitter is no means of support, you can get in touch with [@taskwarrior](https://twitter.com/taskwarrior).
- We have a [User Mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/taskwarrior-user) which you can join anytime to discuss about Taskwarrior and techniques.
- The [Developer Mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/taskwarrior-dev) is focussing on a more technical oriented audience.
